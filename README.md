	*** In this project, I created an app that displays random quotes and colors each time a button is clicked manually, or quotes and colors are changed automatically after a certain amount of time passes.
	
	1. Create an array of objects “quotes” to hold the data for your quotes, and add properties to the quote objects.
	2. Create the getRandomQuote function to get a random quote.
	3. Create the printQuote function to display a quote on the screen.
	4. Create the changeBackgroundColor function to change background color randomly.
	5. Create the autoPlay function to change quotes after a certain amount of time passes.
	6. Create the stopAutoPlay function to stop autoPlay function.
